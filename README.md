# Carsens-LTL-Yahtzee
Sketchup files and artwork for Carsen's Larger Than Life Yahtzee

I used Sketchup 2016 on my computer to create the die and then I copied it 5 times.
The caddy was built after the die and sized to just fit the 5 dice nestled next to each other.
The file, when opened, will show the dice inside the caddy.  This is just for form and fit testing - it doesn't
print this way.  Each object is a group and will have to be exploded if you want to edit them.

# As is, you cannot print the caddy on the Taz Mini 6.
You will want to resize the caddy to fit the smaller print bed.  Pay attention to the scaling you perform and then scale
the dice exactly the same.  Don't forget you only need to print one die - no need to resize all of them.  I created 5 just to
work out the dimensions of the caddy.

# I printed the die with 0.1mm layers, and the caddy with 0.2mm layers.  Both had rafts, no supports.
The dice took 1 hr 37mins each, and the caddy took 5.5hrs.  In Sketchup, I installed the Export STL tool from the 
Extension Warehouse.  After exporting the STL file, I opened it with the 3D printer's software. 

There is a new version of Sketchup
that is completely web-based, but I have never used it.  If it's still free, I recommend getting the installable version.

# The scoresheets were designed and created at design.cricut.com
I printed them and cut them on a Cricut Explore Air 2.  I don't really recommend doing it this way as it takes too long.
Create your own in Word or Inkscape.  The dimensions are 34mm wide and 200mm tall. The PNG file is the basic box, no text.

# Merry Christmas!
